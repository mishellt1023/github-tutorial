## Git vs. GitHub

**What is Git?**
#### Git is a "version control"which keeps the "snapshots"of a code. Git also runs in a command line which
will handles from small to large projects in a effecient speed. Git doesn't require github.

  _Runs in the command line_ 
  ### Basic Workflow
 You have a directory(folder) or files 
1. once we initialize git(or version control), we call it a repository 
2.edit files (save along the way)
3. add files (to the stage)
4.commit them with a message
5.gti push in order to submit your project to the cloud.
   

**What is Github?**
Github stores your code in a cloud and visually track any changes made.Also it could be seen by others on the website [Github](github.com)
which is connected to the cloud:
1.store code in the cloud 
2.visually track changes
3.easily collaborate on files
4.Requires Git

## Initial Setup
You can specify Git configuration settings with the `git config` command.
One of the first things you did was set up your name and email address:

### What is the SSH Key?
A SSH key is

1._git init_ // initializes git in our directory (now called a repository) for version control -- only do this once at the beginning
(edit file(s))
2._git status_ // optional command to see which files have been edited since the last commit (they will be red)
3._git add file.ext_ // add the file(s) to the stage to be committed (note: git add . adds the current/entire directory: all files)
4._git status_ // optional command to see which files are staged for the commit (they will be green)
5._git commit -m “short/specific message”_ // take a ‘snapshot’ of the files on the stage. 
The message should be present-tense and describe what the snapshot is about.
