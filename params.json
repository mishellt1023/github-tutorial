Git also runs in a command line which\r\nwill handles from small to large projects in a effecient speed. Git doesn't require github.\r\n\r\n  _Runs in the command line_ \r\n### Basic Workflow\r\n You have a directory(folder) or files: \r\n \r\n 1. once we initialize git(or version control), we call it a repository \r\n\r\n 2 .edit files (save along the way)\r\n \r\n3 add files (to the stage)\r\n\r\n 4.commit them with a message\r\n\r\n 5.gti push in order to submit your project to the cloud.\r\n   \r\n\r\n**What is Github?**\r\n\r\nGithub stores your code in a cloud and visually track any changes made.Also it could be seen by others\r\non the website [Github.com](github.com)which is connected to the cloud:\r\n\r\n1.store code in the cloud \r\n\r\n2.visually track changes\r\n\r\n3.easily collaborate on files\r\n\r\n4.Requires Git \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Initial Setup\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the SSH Key?\r\nA SSH key stands for Secure Socket Shell is a secures the remotes from the computers,\r\nbut if you fork their repository you will be able to clone it and make it yours.\r\n \r\n### What is git config?\r\nGit config is when you are configuring you username and email in order to connect it to github.\r\nYou can specify Git configuration settings with the `git config` command.\r\nOne of the first things you did was set up your name and email address when making your first repository\r\nyou need use::\r\n    `git config --global user.name “First Last”`\r\n    `git config --global user.email “username@hstat.org”`\r\n  After using git config you would be able to connect it to github.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n---\r\n## Repository Setup\r\nWhen making a new repository you need to go to [github](github.com) then:\r\n\r\n1.At the top right corner there is a  **+** \r\n\r\n2.Click New repository.\r\n\r\n3.Then type a name for your repository\r\n\r\n4.Click \"Create repository\".\r\n\r\n And then you could go back to [cloud 9](c9.io)then you could do `git add`in order to add your file to github \r\nthen commited with a short and specific message. Then do `git push` for the file to go up to the cloud(github)\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Workflow & Commands\r\n\r\n\r\n1._git init_ // initializes git in our directory called a repository for version control\r\n\r\n2._git status_ // is use to check were you at and also to see what you are missing or to check what you did\r\nin order to get to that place.(it will be red if you are missing a step)\r\n\r\n\r\n3._git add file.ext_ // add the file(s) to the stage (for example:\"README.md\" to be committed, after you do `git status`\r\n\r\n4._git status_ // after doing step 3 you do `git status` because you have to check if your file has been added\r\n(then the files name would  be green)\r\n\r\n5._git commit -m \"short and specific message\"_//git commit takes a snapshots of the file by adding a short and specific message.\r\n\r\n6._git push_ // after going`git commit` you do `git push` because you are sending your commits from your local repo \r\ninto your remote repo (up to the cloud: Github)\r\n\r\n7._git pull_//would pull or bring down any changes that someone made,from the remote repository down to your local repository\r\n\r\n \r\n---\r\n## Error handling\r\n\r\nWhen having a error you don't have to panic because there are ways to solve your problems.One of the problems that \r\nwe have as using c9.io is that sometimes we just put `git init` in a wrong repository.So what `git init`does is that\r\nit create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one .\r\n\r\n###Removing\r\n \r\n When moving a repository you have to use `rm -rf`then the name of the repository.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
